When compiled with this patch, Vim will have a new event, "GetChar".

The doc page patch:


                            *GetChar*
GetChar             Called immediately after a character is
                received from the user or typeahead buffer,
                and before it is processed.  The character is
                available in the |v:getchar| variable as a
                string (not a number).  Changing |v:getchar|
                changes the value returned by the
                |getchar()|function.  The |v:getchartype|
                variable can be blank, 'KeyTyped', or
                'KeyStuffed', depending on how the character
                was obtained.  Setting |v:getchar| to ''
                essentially skips the current character.
