  				WinLeave autocommands (but not for ":new").

+ 							*GetChar*
+ GetChar				Called immediately after a character is
+ 				received from the user or typeahead buffer,
+ 				and before it is processed.  The character is
+ 				available in the |v:getchar| variable as a
+ 				string (not a number).  Changing |v:getchar|
+ 				changes the value returned by the
+ 				|getchar()|function.  The |v:getchartype|
+ 				variable can be blank, 'KeyTyped', or
+ 				'KeyStuffed', depending on how the character
+ 				was obtained.  Setting |v:getchar| to ''
+ 				essentially skips the current character.
